# RISC-V-CPU
Basic implementation of a single cycle RISC-V CPU in Python

# How it started
After the end of the first year's first semester at FEUP, studying Computer Science (L.EIC - Licenciatura em Engenharia Informática e Computação), me and other two friends decided to code a simple implementation of a single-cycle CPU, that supports some of the instructions of the RISC-V ISA (Instruction Set Architecture), since it was, for us, the most interesting topic of one of our courses, FSC (Fundamentos de Sistemas Computacionais).
